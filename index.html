      <p>My name is Isabel, I've been in the Bay Area for almost 4 years. After several years int the education background,  I felt I needed a career change. I always enjoy working with my laptop and I find 
        this profession very interesting because my work will help people all over the world, without having to move myself where the client is.</p>

        
        <p>In my opinion becoming a Full Stack Developer will make myself  more valuable and forward-thinking.
        I like the process of learning new languages, and the part you would never stop learning; there is always a new expression that wasnâ€™t before in your vocabulary so I find learning code  would be interesting to me. </p>
